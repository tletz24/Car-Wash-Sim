NOT FINISHED

Ethan’s Car Wash has decided to do a study of their business, which they believe has not been as good as they would have liked. Based on some data they have obtained, they assume the following: 

Customers arrive at the car wash in random integer intervals of 1 to 5 minutes. That is, when a customer arrives, the next customer will arrive in the next 1 to 5 minutes.

Customers are served in random integer intervals of 2 to 5 minutes. That is, when a car is actually washed, it will take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes to finish depending on the level of wash that was selected.
The car wash can only hold up to 8 cars waiting to be serviced.  If a customer arrives and there are 8 cars waiting, the customer will have to bypass the car wash.Ethan’s Car Wash has decided to do a study of their business, which they believe has not been as good as they would have liked.
